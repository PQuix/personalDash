# personalDash

This will be a personal test project and learning experience in regards to PHP.

Goals include, but are not limited to reading and writing to a MySQL database, connecting to one or more API (last.fm, spotify?).

Timeframe for the project is set for 24. December.
Desired result is to be stable enough to support the team in meaningful ways.
